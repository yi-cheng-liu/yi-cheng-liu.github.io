## Goal

This project aims to develop a comprehensive autonomous driving system that includes environmental mapping, vehicle positioning, and control. The system uses a 16-line LiDAR and camera system to create a 3D map, vehicle positioning, and path tracing, with the Robot Operating System (ROS) processing point cloud and image signals in Ubuntu. The Autoware software enables simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), while YOLO V3 assists in object recognition. MATLAB's control instructions are used to generate control commands that are transmitted to the vehicle via the CAN BUS, allowing the system to control steering, braking, and acceleration. The development of this system reflects the growing importance of vehicle safety and the increasing role of advanced driver assistance systems in ensuring it.
