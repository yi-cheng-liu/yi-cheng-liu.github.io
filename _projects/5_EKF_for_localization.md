* Localized a vehicle with ES-EKF using prerecorded sensor data, including IMU, GPS, and LIDAR position updates
* Examined the effects of sensor miscalibration on vehicle pose estimates, and adjusted the filter to compensate for errors
* Investigated the effects of sensor dropout on the vehicle position estimate and the uncertainty in the position estimate
