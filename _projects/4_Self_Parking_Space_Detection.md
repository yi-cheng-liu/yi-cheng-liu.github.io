## Goal

The goal is to determine which parking spaces are empty and which ones are occupied from a top-down view. This system can be useful in car park management systems or smart city applications, where real-time information about parking spaces are provided to users to help them find parking spots quickly and easily. By detecting and monitoring the occupancy of parking spaces, parking facilities can optimize their operations and improve the parking experience for their customers.
