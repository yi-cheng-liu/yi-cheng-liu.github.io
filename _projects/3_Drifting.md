excerpt: "visualize the drifting trajectory"

* Stabilized the side-slip angle to match different desired curvatures and realize drifting motion
* Achieved error dynamics and nonlinear model inversion to calculate desired operating points, steering angle, yaw rate, rear drive force and longitudinal velocity
* Designed LQR controller for steering angle and proportional control for rear drive force
* Held course angle error under 0.9 degrees and visualized the high side-slip maneuver process in Simulink
