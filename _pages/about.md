I am pleased that you visit my website, my name is Yi-Cheng (Jerry) Liu 劉易承, a first-year MS student majoring in **Electrical and Computer Engineering** at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor<img src="https://github.com/yi-cheng-liu/yi-cheng-liu.github.io/blob/master/images/michigan_logo.png" alt="michigan logo" width="50" height="50">. My educational background includes studying **Vehicle Engineering** at National Taipei University of Technology from 2017 to 2021, as well as being a exchange student in the Department of Engineering at the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences (Die Hochschule Karlsruhe).

My passion for technology has always driven me to explore the potential of engineering beyond just problem-solving, but also to identify problems in our society that can be addressed through innovation. With this in mind, I am committed to making a positive impact in the world and using my skills to contribute to creating a better future for all.
